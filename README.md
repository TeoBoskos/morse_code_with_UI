# Morse Code Translator Using Python And Tkinter.
This is a mini_project I made using Python and Tkinter.

# How It Works
This is an app that tells you to put some text into an entry field. Then, if you press `Enter`, or the `Translate`
button, this text is converted to morse code. Lastly, you can clear the entry field and the output label by clicking
the `Clear` button.

# Found any bugs?
If you found any bugs in my program, or if you have an idea on how I can improve, please let me know. I am open to any
kind of criticism that is going to help me improve my skills.
